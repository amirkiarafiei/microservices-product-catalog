#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies 
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even 
#   fail to install them.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
# poetry.lock
